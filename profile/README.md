# Introduction

GreenTrace is an imperative project that champions the protection of our environment and empowers individuals to make a tangible impact on the planet. 🌍 Through our revolutionary combination of IoT, AI, and blockchain technologies, we address critical challenges in the carbon credit market, providing transparency, trust, and accountability to climate action projects and individuals seeking to offset their carbon footprint. 🌱💪

## Key Features
**IoT Sensors:** GreenTrace installs state-of-the-art IoT sensors in climate action projects, enabling real-time data collection on crucial environmental parameters such as humidity, CO2 levels, and more. 🌡️🌿 This comprehensive dataset ensures accurate monitoring and verification of carbon credits, ensuring the integrity of climate action initiatives.

**AI-powered Anomaly Detection:** Our cutting-edge AI model, integrated into a Cartesi machine, meticulously analyzes the collected sensor data for anomalies. By detecting inconsistencies in environmental conditions, such as deviations from normal patterns in the Amazon rainforest, we effectively identify and flag potential harmful human activities like deforestation. 🚫🌳 This proactive approach safeguards our ecosystems and prompts immediate action to halt the minting of carbon credits.

**Blockchain-based Verifier Registry:** GreenTrace establishes a secure and immutable blockchain-based smart contract system, acting as a verifier registry. This technology guarantees transparency and accountability as verifying institutions evaluate climate action projects, estimating the quantity of carbon credits they should generate annually. 🔒⛓️ By storing this information on the blockchain, we foster trust and confidence in the carbon credit market.

**Token Marketplace:** Our user-friendly frontend provides a dynamic marketplace where individuals and companies can effortlessly purchase or retire carbon credit tokens. 🛒💸 GreenTrace empowers individuals to offset their carbon footprint by integrating an API connected to Chainlink Functions. This innovative feature enables users to calculate and offset their carbon emissions from everyday activities such as car rides, public transit trips, or flights. 🚗🚌✈️ With Chainlink's automation capabilities, users can schedule recurring retirements, facilitating long-term carbon offsetting.

**NFTs and Dashboard:** As users actively contribute to carbon offsetting, GreenTrace rewards their dedication with Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) as a testament to their environmental impact. 🏆🌱 Our intuitive dashboard presents interactive graphs and charts, allowing users to track their progress and witness the positive change they are making. This gamified approach motivates individuals to continuously reduce their carbon footprint and actively participate in the fight against climate change. 📈🌍

**Leaderboards:** GreenTrace celebrates the accomplishments of companies and climate action projects through our engaging leaderboards. By recognizing the top contributors in carbon credit retirement and carbon credit generation, we foster healthy competition, encouraging greater involvement and inspiring others to join the cause. 🥇🏢🌿
